# Paint App

A beautiful drawing view for a your flutter application.

To start with this, we need to simply add the dependencies in the gradle file of our app module like this

Don't forget to star ‚≠ê the repo it motivates me to share more open source

## Installation

First, add `flutter_draw:` as a [dependency in your pubspec.yaml file](https://flutter.io/platform-plugins/).

Import

```dart
import 'package:flutter_draw/flutter_draw.dart';
```

### iOS

Add the following keys to your _Info.plist_ file, located in `<project root>/ios/Runner/Info.plist`:

* `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription` - describe why your app needs permission for the photo library. This is called _Privacy - Photo Library Usage Description_ in the visual editor.
* `NSCameraUsageDescription` - describe why your app needs access to the camera. This is called _Privacy - Camera Usage Description_ in the visual editor.
* `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` - describe why your app needs access to the microphone, if you intend to record videos. This is called _Privacy - Microphone Usage Description_ in the visual editor.

Or in text format add the key:

``` xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>Used to demonstrate image picker plugin</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>Used to demonstrate image picker plugin</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>Used to capture audio for image picker plugin</string>
```

### Android

No configuration required - the plugin should work out of the box.

Add this function to Your StateFull Widget Check the [Example]()

```dart

 Future<void> getDrawing()  {
    final getDraw =   Navigator.push(context, MaterialPageRoute(
        builder: (context){
          return HomePage();
        }
    )).then((getDraw){
      if(getDraw != null){
        setState(() {
          _drawImage =  getDraw;
        });
      }
    }).catchError((er){print(er);});

  }
```
